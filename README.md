## HIGGS and SUSY processes

This work tries to replicate the results from the article [Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4735). In the original paper they used Theano and Pylearn2 with Python. The models were trained using 6 Intel Xeon cores, an NVIDIA Tesla C2070 graphics processor, and 64 GB memory. In this work, we used Keras with python; and the models were trained with an Intel Core i3-8100, an NVIDIA GTX 1050Ti GPU and 8GB memory.
